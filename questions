in defining login routes, cant we do something like api/users/login

what happens when the person puts a right key and header is set, and then afterwards the person puts a wrong key will header still be there, can the user still do operation the old user could do

why do we have to start the name of the header property with 'x-'

how is storing your jwt secret key on an env variable safe,
cant a malicious user get the secret key from config the same way we are getting it?

when i stop nodemon, or i restart my app. the token generated before i stoped the app is still valid. why? wouldnt that cause some insecurity?
